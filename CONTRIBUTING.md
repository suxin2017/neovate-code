## Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a feature request? You can use our built-in slash commands to create GitHub issues directly from the CLI:

- `/bug-report` - Report a bug with automated context collection
- `/feature-request` - Suggest a new feature or enhancement

These commands will guide you through providing the necessary information and create a properly formatted GitHub issue.

## Prepare

Setup the API keys for the LLMs providers, use the env variables in your bashrc/zshrc/fishrc files or use `/login` the select a provider and enter the API Key.

If you are using VSCode or Cursor, install [Biome extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) to format the code.

## Development

It's recommended to use [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to manage the node and pnpm version. And you need to set the `VOLTA_FEATURE_PNPM` environment variable to enable pnpm support.

```bash
export VOLTA_FEATURE_PNPM=1
```

Install and build the CLI.

```bash
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm build
```

Run the CLI.

```bash
$ pnpm dev
```

Tips: Add `t` alias to the `src/cli.ts` file to make it easier to run the CLI.

```bash
$ alias t="bun /path/to/neovate/src/cli.ts"
$ t
```

Note: After installation, you can use either `neovate` to run the CLI.

Before you commit, you need to run the `ready` script to check if the code is ready to be committed.

```bash
$ pnpm ready
# Or include e2e tests
$ pnpm ready --e2e
```

## How to run e2e tests

The e2e tests validate the CLI functionality end-to-end using real model interactions.

Before running the e2e tests, you need to configure the model. Set the `E2E_MODEL` environment variable in your `.env` file and ensure you have the appropriate API keys configured for your chosen model.

```bash
# .env
E2E_MODEL=provider_id/model_id
```

Then you can run the e2e tests.

```bash
$ pnpm test:e2e
# Run tests for a specific fixture
$ pnpm test:e2e --only normal
# Run tests for a specific test
$ pnpm test:e2e --only normal/basic
```

## Debug

Choose one of the following methods to debug the CLI:

1. Press `⌘+⇧+D` to open the debug view, then select `Debug cli`.
2. Add `DEBUG=neovate*` prefix to the command to print the debug logs.
3. Add `-q` to the command to print the quiet logs.
4. Open session files under `~/.neovate/projects/` directory to check the logs.

### Testing NodeBridge Handlers

Use the `test-nodebridge.ts` script to test NodeBridge message handlers directly:

```bash
# List all available handlers
bun scripts/test-nodebridge.ts --list

# Test a specific handler with --key=value arguments
bun scripts/test-nodebridge.ts models.list
bun scripts/test-nodebridge.ts models.test --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
bun scripts/test-nodebridge.ts utils.getPaths --cwd /path/to/dir --maxFiles 100

# Pass complex data as JSON (--data takes priority over --key value)
bun scripts/test-nodebridge.ts models.test --data '{"model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514","timeout":5000}'
```

## Release

```bash
$ pnpm release
$ pnpm release:minor
$ pnpm release:major
```

After running the release command, use `/share-release` to generate release share.
